                                    Stay physically active: Physical activity is not only essential for physical health but also for mental health. 
                                Exercise releases endorphins, which are natural chemicals that can improve mood and reduce stress.
                                Aim to get at least 30 minutes of physical activity per day, such as walking, jogging, or cycling.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Connect with others: Social connections are crucial for mental health. Spend time with friends and family, join a social club or group, or volunteer in your community.
                                Connecting with others can help reduce feelings of loneliness and increase feelings of happiness and fulfillment.
                                </p>

                                    Get enough sleep: Sleep is essential for mental health. Lack of sleep can lead to increased stress, anxiety, and depression.
                                Aim to get at least 7-8 hours of sleep per night,
                                and establish a regular sleep routine to help improve sleep quality.
                                </p>

                                    Seek professional help: If you're struggling with mental health issues, don't hesitate to seek professional help.
                                Talk to your healthcare provider or a mental health professional 
                                to discuss treatment options that may be right for you.
